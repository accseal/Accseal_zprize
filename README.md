# GZKP-demo
Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol with computational integrity and privacy. It allows one party to convince the other that a certain assertion is correct without providing any useful information. Zero-knowledge proof is widely used in privacy-related applications, such as digital currency, verifiable machine learning, verifiable database outsourcing, etc. The computation process is mainly composed of three modules: parameter generator, prover, and verifier.

The computational bottleneck of the zero-knowledge proof system is the prover module. Slow proof generation speed significantly limits the system throughput. We develop the GZKP-demo, A GPU system that supports various ZKP applications. GZKP-demo supports multiple elliptic curves, such as MNT4753, BLS12_381, and ALT_BN128.
